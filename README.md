Pilau Base
=======

* This is a parent theme for creating custom WordPress sites.
* It's intended for use with the child theme [Pilau Starter](https://github.com/pilau/starter).
* This is also where [general documentation for Pilau stuff](https://github.com/pilau/base/wiki) can be found.

Pilau is a suite of tools for creating custom WordPress sites created by developers working with the agency [Public Life](http://www.publiclife.co.uk/). It's heavily focused on client work there, and is designed as a bare-bones starting point for our projects. However, we're very happy if anyone finds our work of use! If you feel like contributing, even better.

Pilau theming is split into a parent theme (Base) and a child theme (Starter) so that things like security measures and basic functions in Base can be easily updated across sites. It's a parent theme rather than a plugin because Starter's dependency on it is thus easier to enforce.

There's also a number of Pilau [WordPress plugins](https://github.com/pilau/base/wiki/Pilau-plugins).

Pilau uses code and inspiration from the following projects:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s)
* [Modernizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr)
