Pilau Base
=======

* This is a parent theme for creating custom WordPress sites.
* It's intended for use with the child theme [Pilau Starter](https://github.com/pilau/starter).

[Pilau](http://pilaubase.com/) is a suite of tools for creating custom WordPress sites created by developers working with the agency [Public Life](http://www.publiclife.co.uk/), is heavily focused on client work there, and is designed as a bare-bones starting point for our projects.

However, we're very happy if anyone finds our work of use! If you feel like contributing, even better.

Pilau is split into a parent theme (Base) and a child theme (Starter) so that Base can be released on the wordpress.org themes repository, allowing easy updates to the core functionality in base (especially security measures and basic functions).
